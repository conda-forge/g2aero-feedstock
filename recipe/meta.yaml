  summary: 'G2Aero: Separable shape tensors for aerodynamic applications'
  description: |
    G2Aero is a flexible and practical tool for design and deformation of 
    2D airfoils and 3D blades using data-driven approaches. G2Aero 
    utilizes the geometry of matrix manifoldsâ€”specifically the Grassmannian
    to build a novel framework for representing physics-based separable 
    deformations of shapes. G2Aero offers the flexibility to generate 
    perturbations in a customizable way over any portion of the blade. 
    The G2Aero framework utilizes data-driven methods based on a curated 
    database of physically relevant airfoils.
